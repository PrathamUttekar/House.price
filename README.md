# House Price Prediction Algorithm
Welcome to the House Price Prediction Algorithm repository! This project aims to predict house prices using a combination of linear regression and XGBoost models. The project involves data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Importing and cleaning the dataset using pandas.
- Feature Encoding: Encoding categorical features using OrdinalEncoder.
- Data Visualization: Visualizing the dataset and relationships using matplotlib and seaborn.
- Model Training:
   - Linear Regression: Initial model to establish baseline predictions.
   - XGBoost: Advanced model to improve prediction accuracy.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance and accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Data visualization.
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization.
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library for linear regression and preprocessing.
- XGBoost: Optimized gradient boosting library for enhanced prediction accuracy.

## How It Works
### 1. Data Preprocessing
Import the dataset using pandas.
Handle missing values and clean the data.
### 2. Feature Encoding
Use OrdinalEncoder from scikit-learn to encode categorical features.
### 3. Data Visualization
Visualize the dataset using matplotlib and seaborn to understand data distributions and relationships.
### 4. Model Training
 - #### Linear Regression:
Train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
Evaluate the model's baseline performance.
 - #### XGBoost:
Train an XGBoost model on the same dataset.
Compare the performance with the linear regression model to assess improvement.
### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of both models using appropriate metrics.
Visualize the results to compare the effectiveness of each model.
